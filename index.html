American Economic Review, vol. 115, no. 8, 2025<br><br>

Best Paper Award at Oxford Centre for Business Taxation Doctoral Conference 2019<br> IIPF Young Economists Award 2019<br>
        <p class="abstract">This paper estimates the direct effects and indirect spillover effects of investment tax credits on firms. Exploiting a differential tax credit rate change by firm size in the German manufacturing sector, I find that lowering a firm’s investment cost by 7.6 percent increases its capital stock by 17.7 percent and employment by 12.0 percent. Positive local spillovers generate one additional manufacturing job for each directly created job, are strongest between firms in industries connected through input-output linkages, and arise within distances of five kilometers. Firms dependent on local consumer demand also increase employment, while within-industry spillovers generate small negative effects.</p>

            <p class="abstract">We analyze how the formal recognition of foreign qualifications affects immigrants’ labor market outcomes. The empirical analysis is based on a novel German data set that links respondents’ survey information to their administrative records, allowing us to observe immigrants at monthly intervals before, during, and after their application for occupational recognition. We find that 3 years after obtaining recognition, immigrants earn 19.8% higher wages and are 24.5 percentage points more likely to be employed than immigrants in the control group. We further document that occupational recognition leads to full convergence of immigrants’ earnings to those of their native counterparts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">School closings have been a key policy measure worldwide for reducing the spread of corona-virus disease (COVID-19). In Germany, federal states closed schools in mid-March and started to reopen them in late April. This policy potentially increased parental obligations for supervision and support during homeschooling and, thus, might reinforce social inequality in educational opportunities. Therefore, this research note investigates social inequality in students’ homeschooling efforts. Moreover, it asks whether social disparities in home learning environments, social support, teacher support, and cost–benefit-related considerations account for the social differences in homeschooling efforts during the school closing period in Germany. To that end, we use data from an ongoing research project on high school students in their final years that were collected during the school closing period. Our results show pronounced differences in home schooling efforts by social background. Thus far, the mechanisms under study can explain only a moderate part of the social origin effect. In summary, the results show that school closings have the potential to exacerbate social inequality in educational opportunities. Therefore, future research should scrutinise the extent to which school closings reinforce inequality in educational opportunities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We argue that skill-biased technological change not only affects wage gaps between skill groups, but also increases wage inequality within skill groups, across workers in different workplaces. Building on a heterogeneous firm framework with labor market frictions, we show that an industry-wide skill-biased technological change shock will increase between-firm wage inequality within the industry through four main channels: changes in the skill wage premium (as in traditional models of technological change); increased employment concentration in more productive firms; increased wage dispersion between firms for workers of the same skill type; and increased dispersion in the skill mix that firms employ, due to more sorting of skilled workers to more productive firms. Using rich administrative matched employer-employee data from Germany, we provide empirical evidence of establishment-level patterns that are in line with the predictions of the model. We further document that industries with more technological adoption exhibit particularly pronounced patterns along the dimensions highlighted by the model.</p>

<p class="abstract">Economic espionage is a pervasive global phenomenon. We study how this activity affects the performance and production structure of firms in the perpetrating country. Exploiting historical data from East Germany that trace the flow of scientific-technical information from their sources in the West to their recipients in East Germany, we show that economic espionage increased firms’ output, productivity and exports. Our results further suggest that the technical change induced by economic espionage was factor-neutral, and that the associated productivity gains propagated through the production network via input-output linkages. In the long run, a higher inflow of espionage information was associated with a higher likelihood of successful privatization following German reunification.</p>

<p class="abstract">The post-secondary education choice shapes long-term life and labor market outcomes, yet students often make this decision with limited information and face substantial uncertainties. This paper estimates the causal effects of a large-scale German school policy that expanded the free access to assistance from professional career counselors. By randomly delaying the start of the policy for a subset of schools, we find that students with expanded counseling access are more likely to postpone their decision and decide against college education, particularly university degrees. Nevertheless, they report greater satisfaction with their choice and are less likely to drop out. Using hypothetical choice data, we show that students update their beliefs about how their parents view different education choices and about having sufficient finanical resources later in life. We also provide evidence that friendship networks play a role in strengthening effects from individual counseling.</p>


<p class="papertitle"> <span>How Do Parents Affect The College Education Choice
of Their Children?</span><br> with <a class="coauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.shihanghou.com/">Shihang Hou</a></p>
<p class="abstract">This paper provides new evidence on the role of parents in their children's post-secondary education choice. Using linked survey data from nearly 2,000 parent–child pairs in Germany, we document substantial differences in how parents and children assess the expected relative costs and benefits of college. Even shortly before the final decision, their expectations are only weakly correlated, with parent–child correlations ranging from –0.019 to 0.289 across a wide set of outcomes. To quantify the impact of these divergent views, we estimate a joint choice model that incorporates both child and parent preferences. We find that, for example, children place a stronger weight on enjoying their studies, whereas parents put relatively more emphasis on completing a degree. Estimating the model separately by socio-economic background reveals that differences in expectations between college-educated and non-college-educated parents account for 19 percent of the college-enrollment gap between their children, while differences in parental preferences explain an additional 25 percent.These findings highlight that policy interventions targeting parental beliefs and preferences can be effective in reducing inequalities in college-going.</p>

<p class="papertitle"> <span>Trade Shocks and Local Public Finance: Evidence from German Municipalities</span><br> with <a class="coauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jkochems.github.io/">Johannes Kochems</a></p>
<p class="abstract">When local governments' funding opportunities are linked to the local economy, changes in the import and export competition may influence the revenue that local governments can raise. This paper estimates the effect of trade shocks on German municipalities' fiscal outcomes for the period from 1992 to 2012. We find that increased exposure to import competition has a detrimental effect on municipality revenues and expenditures, while additional export opportunities lead to positive effects. The adjustment of expenditures importantly depends on municipalities' initial fiscal and economic conditions. Municipalities with a higher initial debt per capita predominantly react by adjusting their debt repayment. In contrast, municipalities with a low initial debt per capita are able to expand public investment in response to positive export shocks.</p>
